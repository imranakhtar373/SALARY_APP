## Dataset Content:-

The dataset consists of 65112 rows by doing surveys of peoples from all over the world to know how much they earn in a year 

## Business Requirements :-

. As a Data Analyst we are asked to provide actionable insights and data-driven recommendations to a big survey company. The client want to to see all the average pay scale of different locations of world. the client is also wants to know which country pay the most to their employerss.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

we have the data of more than 65000 peoples in which their experience /year of 
 graduation and the data of their location is avaliable. this data will help us to let us know which country is more beneficial for software developers

 ## DATA VISUALIZATION AND EDA

BUSSINESS REQUIREMENT 1 :- data visualization

* we will display all the data and perfom a detailed EDA to take a look how hour data looks likes and get some basic insights and information of the data.

* we have to then identify how much null values ae in there

BUSSINESS REQUIREMENT 2 :- LINEAR REGRESSION
* WE have TO predit which country pays the most and which dont
* we have to create reports after doing data cleaning and model training.
  

  ## ML BUSSINESS CASE TO APPLY
  
 . we have to create a ml model in which model predicts the exact value based on the real time data and information. its a super-vised machine learning model that predicts the value from the continues scale
 . our main aim is to provide the team a perfact analysis and reports whoch help them out rapidly and save their time
 . The model output is giving the value based on location experience and education
 . THE training data fit the model come from the stack overflow general survry of 2020 .


 ## Streamlit Interface
 
## Page 1 :- The predicition Page
. In this age the user will just put some infothe form of location / education level and yearss of experience.
. the model will analyse it quickly and provide the best info and prediciton about that
. First you will get a massive number of countries list
under you will find the education level 
and then you will put on the number of year (experienced)

## Page 2 :- the graph page
. In this page you will get the number of graphs showing the exact percentage and raising of salaries by years.
. a PIE CHART
. A LINE GRAPH 

## BUGS :-
2 issues were detected 
one was in streamlit and second one was in THE ML MODEL 

. streamlit issue resolved √
. ML model issue resolved √
